This is a fork of [GraphSharp](https://graphsharp.codeplex.com). I'm currently unwilling to maintain it beyond my personal needs.

- The dependency on [WPFExtensions](https://wpfextensions.codeplex.com/) has been removed by integrating all relevant controls directly into GraphSharp.Controls. The control behavior has been changed / optimized a bit with regards to dragging and zooming.
